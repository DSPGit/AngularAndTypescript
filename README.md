Why angular?
- Its a framework [browser/mobile]

- It is a modular framework
	- what is modular:
		- divide or slice your prog
		- pick only the slice you need
		
- Performance

- Component architecture
	- Web component development is bundle of below 3 layers:
		- HTML
		- CSS
		- Javascript
	
- Extending the vocab of HTML

- You can build a SPA(Single page application) in angular

- Rich built in data binding capabilities which includes
	- One way
		- [Source to destination]/[Destination to source]
	- Two way

- Built in directives
	- directive is nothing but custom attributes for html tags (directives
	- angular also provides built in custom elements
	
- Data transformation
	- dynamic data transformation eg: if I select India as country then it should show currency in INR, etc
	- Pipes : this is used for data transformation
	
- Forms
	- template forms (simple forms where validation are done on UI)
	- reactive forms (forms where validation are done on model)
	
- Dynamic/JIT(just in time) compilation and AoT compilation
	- Do the changes in development and the compilation happens at client side then its Dynamic compilation (preferred in development mode, as compilation is done while dev simultaneously)
	- Do the changes, build a package, test it and deploy then it is called AoT (ahead of time) compilation (also called as pre compilation of application and is prefered in prod) --> performance is more better as it is tested

- HTPP module

- Rich animations

- Eager loading vs Lazy loading

- Routing

- Language support for angular application development
	- you can develope angular using 4 different languages
		- ES5
		- ECMA2015
		- Typescript
		- Dart

- Test ready code: Karma (test runner by google) / Jasmine (framework)
	- Jasmine functions:
		- Describe It

- Changes Detection cycle - is a process which is uni-directional

- Guidelines for Angular are available and Angular tells you what and why a particular thing is to be used. Refer : https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-guide

- Di capabilities (Dependency injection)
